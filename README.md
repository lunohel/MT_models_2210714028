Models for Master's Thesis

This repository contains the models developed during the thesis. The main files include the 2D single-channel monolith model and the 1D model of the coupon reactor. To run the scripts, all files are needed as these include functions for gas properties and also the solver for the velocity profile. 

... do not change the file names
... store them all in the same folder
... functions for velocity profile and properties do not need to be opened, the main models access them independently

Different data such as the gas composition is missing in the code. As this is confidential information, the viewer is referred to the thesis and needs to add this data in the corresponding definition in the model files.
